    <title>Dr. Ruiz Statement on Cuts to Medicare and Social Security in the Presidentâ€™s Budget</title>
    <link>http://ruiz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dr-ruiz-statement-on-cuts-to-medicare-and-social-security-in-the</link>
    <description>&amp;nbsp;Washington, DC&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Today Dr. Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert) released the following statement on the proposed cuts to Medicare and Social Security included in the President&amp;rsquo;s budget:&amp;ldquo;I was disappointed that the President&amp;rsquo;s budget released today included cuts to Medicare and Social Security. Putting the burden of the national deficit on the backs of our seniors is wrong, and I will stand with our seniors to oppose any effort from either political party that would cut their hard-earned benefits and force them to pay even more out-of-pocket for health care. At a time when many seniors are barely making ends meet, we should be working in a bipartisan way to responsibly reduce the deficit and strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and I am committed to working with both political parties toward that end.&amp;rdquo;###</description>

    <title>Dr. Ruiz Delivers Floor Speech in Opposition to the Ryan Budget  </title>
    <link>http://ruiz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/dr-ruiz-delivers-floor-speech-in-opposition-to-the-ryan-budget</link>
    <description>Washington, DC &amp;ndash; Dr. Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert) delivered remarks on the House floor today in opposition to the Fiscal Year 2014 Ryan Budget, which ends the Medicare guarantee for seniors.&amp;nbsp;Below are Dr. Ruiz&amp;rsquo;s remarks:&amp;ldquo;This Congress has a responsibility and an opportunity to work together to grow our economy and set this nation on a fiscally responsible path. However, the Ryan budget is irresponsible and places the burden of the deficit on hard-working American families and seniors. This plan ends the guarantee of Medicare.&amp;ldquo;As an ER doctor, I know that many of my senior patients are struggling financially and rely on Medicare. Our priority should be reducing healthcare costs in order to make Medicare stronger and sustainable. But this budget transforms Medicare into a voucher program, shifting the cost of health care to our seniors.&amp;ldquo;We must work together to protect and preserve Medicare, reduce our deficit, and decrease healthcare costs. I urge my colleagues to come together across party lines and put American families and our seniors first.&amp;rdquo;###</description>

    <title>Rep. Ruiz Joins House in Passing Violence Against Women Act</title>
    <link>http://ruiz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-ruiz-joins-house-in-passing-violence-against-women-act</link>
    <description>February 28, 2013WASHINGTON, DC&amp;nbsp;--- U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz, M.D. (D-Palm Desert) today voted in favor of the bipartisan Senate-passed version of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The bill, which passed the House by a margin of&amp;nbsp;286-138, will now go to the President&amp;rsquo;s desk for signature. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;No woman should ever have to suffer domestic abuse,&amp;rdquo; said Rep. Ruiz. &amp;ldquo;The passage of this critical legislation is a victory for women in the 36th&amp;nbsp;District and across the country, and I was proud to stand with a bipartisan majority of my colleagues to reauthorize this landmark law. The bill we passed today will ensure that all victims of domestic and sexual abuse, regardless of their background, are given the protections they deserve and have access to the resources they need to seek justice.&amp;rdquo;In addition to voting in support of the bipartisan Senate-passed version of VAWA today, Rep. Ruiz joined the House in voting down a weaker House GOP version of the bill that excluded protections for Native American, immigrant, and LGBT women.&amp;nbsp;The reauthorization bill the House passed provides stronger protections for all women and&amp;nbsp;strengthens the ability of the Federal Government, the States, law enforcement, and service providers to combat domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.&amp;nbsp;Yesterday, during his first speech on the House floor as a U.S. Representative, Rep. Ruiz urged passage of a strong, comprehensive version of VAWA and spoke out against the weaker House GOP version of the bill. A clip of that video is available&amp;nbsp;here&amp;nbsp;and the remarks as prepared for delivery are below.###&amp;nbsp;STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE RAUL RUIZFLOOR STATEMENTS.47&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013&amp;nbsp;Thank You Mr. Speaker.I would like to thank the Senate for working in a bipartisan manner to pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. However, the House Republican version of the bill fails to protect all women, including Native American women, immigrant women and the LGBT community.I rise today in strong opposition to the House Republican version of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.&amp;nbsp; As an ER doctor I have seen firsthand the beaten and bruised bodies of women and the invisible scars left on the victim, her family and community.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Native American women in my district and across the country endure an epidemic of domestic violence and in most cases the abusers are not members of the tribe. Tribes must have the right to protect their daughters, sisters and mothers from violence.&amp;nbsp;We must work to make sure that all women are protected from domestic violence.I urge all of my colleagues to join me in opposition to the House Republican version of this legislation and I look forward to the passage of the bipartisan Senate version of this legislation. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</description>

    <description>&amp;nbsp;Washington, DC&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz, M.D. (D-Palm Desert) today voted for H.R. 273 to overturn an automatic pay raise for Members of Congress and continue the current federal government pay freeze. This legislation is estimated to save U.S. taxpayers $11 billion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;During a time when many families in the 36th&amp;nbsp;District are struggling to make ends meet and our country is facing a $17 trillion national debt and the threat of deep, across-the-board cuts to defense and health care programs, the last thing Members of Congress should be doing is giving themselves a taxpayer-funded pay raise,&amp;rdquo; said Rep. Ruiz. &amp;ldquo;It is time for Congress to show the American people we are serious about eliminating unnecessary spending, and that begins with personal accountability and ending wasteful pay raises for ourselves.&amp;rdquo;H.R. 273 passed the House by a margin of 261 to 154, with 43 Democrats, including Rep. Ruiz, voting in support.###</description>
